# Face Recognition with LBPH and OpenCV

This project is a simple, real-time face recognition system using **OpenCV** and the **Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH)** algorithm.  
It can detect and recognize faces through a webcam feed, as well as from images or reflections.

## Features
- Real-time face recognition with OpenCV.
- LBPH algorithm (robust under different lighting conditions).
- Easy dataset creation and training pipeline.
- Supports multiple individuals with labeled IDs.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (with contrib modules):
